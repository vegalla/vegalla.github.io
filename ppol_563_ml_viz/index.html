                This work is inspired by and draws from the work of Cuthbert Chow, Jim Vallandingham, and Michael Bostock. 
                Links to their resources are located at the bottom.

                I hope to provide a tutorial on this technique to assist peers in my Master's of Data Science for Public Policy
                at Georgetown University, who may be interested in creating data story web pages.
                Although this was my original intent, I have settled with providing an overview of important concepts necessary to get started with a data story web page.

                On the right, there is a D3.js visualization of a network graph. 
                It's underlying data is the DC Metro system, although you might not be able to tell from it's shape!
                Although the connections are intact, it's layout is produced by D3.js force simulations.

                The internet has facilitated tremendous exchange of information. Content may be hosted on HTML web pages and in the early days of the internet,
                sites were simple and plain. The growth of web services has led to an array of methods that enhance a page's appeal.
                With HTML, images may be embedded into the page as a method of showcasing visualization. However, these images will be static.
                D3.js offers incredible potential for dynamic and interactive visualization on the web as seen in data stories.
                <br><br>
                The data visualizations shared by Madeline and Yousuf highlight data stories that enhance user engagement
                with animated charts, hoverable tool tips, selectable options, etc.
                <br><br>

                Madeline shared <a href = 'https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/'>Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?</a>, exploring music with text analysis.

                <br><br>
                While these visualizations were created by professional web developers, these skills don't have to be out of reach for us.
                However, navigating through the plethora of resources available may be difficult and I hope to summarize the components critical for getting started.
