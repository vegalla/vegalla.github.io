                <h1>Graph Machine Learning</h1>
                
                <p>By Vince Egalla</p>
                
                <p>
                Graph machine learning offers an intriguing approach into understanding the underlying patterns of a network.
                <br><br>
                But what is a network? You first thought may be a social network, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
                where each friend or follow is a connected point. That is correct - but is only one application.
                <br><br>
                The internet itself may also be considered a network, where each website and its internal links are a point.
                Scrolling through a page from one link to another to surf the web is navigation through the network.
                <br><br> 
                The graph on the right is also a network you could navigate through! Can you guess what it is?

                Hover over a node! You may recognize your the DC Metro station from your daily commute!
                <br><br>
                This graph doesn't look remotely close to the WMATA map, but it is the DC Metro System.
                It is produced by allowing graph physics to set the layout. 
                <br><br>
                I'll be using this network for graph machine learning:
                deep semi-supervised learning for prediction of a station's line

                <h2>Graph Theory</h2>
                Graphs are mathematical structures that model relationships between objects. A graph is
                composed of objects (nodes) and are connected by a relationship (edge). Nodes are also known as
                vertices and points. Edges are also known as links and lines. 
                <br><br>
                There are undirected graphs, in which the edge is symmetric, indicating the relationship between 
                objects goes both ways, and also directed graphs, in which edges may only go in one direction. 
                For example, Arthur and Beth follow each other on social media creating a symmetric relationship, 
                while Charles only follows Beth in an asymmetric relationship. 
                <br><br>
                Graphs may be classified as simple, in which nodes may only have one connecting edge
                between each other, or as a multi-graph allowing multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, graphs may permit loops or not, in which a node may connect to itself with an edge.

                <h2>DC Metro System</h2>
                Compared to the previous layout, the nodes are now in their relative geographic positions.
                Even without the DC / Maryland / Virginia borders, can you better identify the shape of the metro system?
