An interactive, scrollable visualisation tutorial and template created in my Data Visualiztaion class, while attending a Master's for Data Science for Public Policy (MSDSPP) at Georgetown University.

Guidelines:

* Be from 1500-2000 words
* Be written so it is accessible to a broad audience
* Includes screenshots/visualizations when appropriate
* Provides commented code if producing visualizations from an Open Source package
