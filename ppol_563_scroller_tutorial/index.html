                <h1>How can I create an interactive data visualization that updates as users scroll through?</h1>
                <p>By Vince Egalla</a></p>
                <p>(Note: If the visualisation doesn't fit your screen, try zooming out with ctrl + - / Cmd + -.) </p>
                <p>
                This work is inspired by and draws from the work of Cuthbert Chow, Jim Vallandingham, and Michael Bostock.
                <br><br>
                I am inspired to provide a tutorial on this technique to assist peers in my Master's of Data Science for Public Policy
                at Georgetown University, who may be interested in creating data story websites.

                The internet has facilitated tremendous exchange of information. Content may be hosted on HTML web pages and in the early days of the internet,
                sites were simple and plain. The growth of web services has led to an array of methods that enhance a page's appeal.
                With HTML, images may be embedded into the page as a method of showcasing visualization. However, these images will be static.
                D3.js offers incredible potential for dynamic and interactive visualization on the web as seen in data stories.
                <br><br>
                The data visualizations shared by Madeline and Yousuf highlight data stories that enhance user engagement
                with animated charts, hoverable tool tips, selectable options, etc.
                <br><br>
                Madeline shared <a href = 'https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/'>Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?</a>, exploring music with text analysis.
                <br><br>
                Yousuf shared <a href = 'http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/'>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</a>, covering drone strikes in Pakistan.
                <br><br>
                While these visualizations were created by professional web developers, these skills don't have to be out of reach for us.
                However, navigating through the plethora of resources available may be difficult and I hope to summarize the components critical for getting started.
                </p>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                The four important components of this visualization are:
                <ul>
                    <li>index.html</li>
                    <li>scroller.js</li>
                    <li>section.js</li>
                    <li>style.css</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <b>index.html</b> contains the website metadata and text content. 
                <br><br>
                <b>section.js</b> handles data input and draws the visualization using D3.js.
                <br><br>
                <b>style.css</b> provides additional styling details.
                <br><br>
                <b>scroller.js</b> adds the scrolling-updating component to the website.
                <br><br>
                Testing of your web page may be done through a local web server, implemented through Python.
                After setting your working directory to where the HTML is located, use the following:
                <br><br>
                <code>python3 -m http.server</code>
                <br><br>
                For sharing to broader audiences, code may be commited to github and made accessible through <a href = 'https://pages.github.com/'>github.io</a>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class = 'step'>
                <p>
                <h2><a href = 'https://github.com/vegalla/vegalla.github.io/blob/630ea98864c60896be308f78d62004e502a6d675/ppol_563_scroller_tutorial/index.html'>index.html</a></h2>
                This file can be broken into two major sections: head and body. 
                For HTML, the head and body can be distinguished through the tags 
                <code> < head > < / head > </code> or <code> < body > < / body > </code>. 
                Understanding how tags are used is essential to writing an HTML web page.
                <br><br>
                The head contains the web page title and meta data. 
                The title appears as text within a tab of a web browser. Meta data provides additional information about the page.
                <br><br>
                In order to use D3.js, it has to be called on, as seen in line 6 of this file. 
                You may click on the header to access the HTML file, available through Github.
                Since the D3.js code is available online, it doesn't have to downloaded or installed locally to function as long as it is properly referenced.
                <br><br>
                The text you've been reading through is contained with the body section. 
                Within the body, I've used three HTML tags for Header 1, Header 2, and Paragraph.
                Additionally, text is particularly located in 'step' sections that incorporate the interactive scrolling, explained below.

                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>sections.js</h2>
                The network graph is visualized within the sections.js file. This occurs when sections.js is called at the end of index.html.
                I'll cover the flow of code to interpret how separate files are now coordinating the visualize the graph on a single page.
                <br><br>
                First, there is a <code> < div > </code> section with the ID 'viz', located below the 'step' sections. 
                Within sections.js, this 'viz' section is assigned an Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) with width, height, and margin parameters.
                This SVG is the canvas, which the network graph is drawn on.
                <br><br>
                The graph data, as a JSON file, is imported. The graph has keys for nodes and links. 
                Each node has a unique ID and will be drawn as a circle on the graph. Each link has a source and target that connects nodes together.
                The layout of the nodes is then determined by a force simulation. The nodes are centered around the SVG and ultimately settle on a location,
                based on some repulsion/attraction paramters.
                <br><br>
                The final position of the nodes occurs iteratively from when all nodes are initially drawn on the top left corner.
                The iterations occur quick enough that it's apparently instantaneous. 
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <br><br><br><br><br>
                At the bottom of sections.js, there are functions for actions on scrolling. 
                At minimum, I've maintained the fade in/out of text as the user navigates 'step' sections, compared to Cuthbert Chow's original code.
                This occurs as the scroller maintains an index of the 'step' sections and tracks user placement on the page.
                Inactive indices are faded out to maintain focus on relevant text.
                <br><br>
                Within sections.js, I would also plan to code animations, tool tips, etc. for the visualization on the right. 
                However, given the intended challenge of creating a custom visualization, I have not yet incorporated animating the network graph.
                <br><br>
                I am settling for a single network graph visualization for this assignment, but will continue to build upon this for the final visualization.
