                This work is inspired by and draws from the work of Cuthbert Chow, Jim Vallandingham, and Michael Bostock. 
                Links to their resources are located at the bottom.
                <br><br>
                I am inspired to provide a tutorial on this technique to assist peers in my Master's of Data Science for Public Policy
                at Georgetown University, who may be interested in creating data story web pages.

                The internet has facilitated tremendous exchange of information. Content may be hosted on HTML web pages and in the early days of the internet,
                sites were simple and plain. The growth of web services has led to an array of methods that enhance a page's appeal.
                With HTML, images may be embedded into the page as a method of showcasing visualization. However, these images will be static.
                D3.js offers incredible potential for dynamic and interactive visualization on the web as seen in data stories.
                <br><br>
                The data visualizations shared by Madeline and Yousuf highlight data stories that enhance user engagement
                with animated charts, hoverable tool tips, selectable options, etc.
                <br><br>
                <!-- The following line is the first instance of hyperlinking with HTML -->
                Madeline shared <a href = 'https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/'>Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?</a>, exploring music with text analysis.
                <br><br>
                Yousuf shared <a href = 'http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/'>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</a>, covering drone strikes in Pakistan.
                <br><br>
                While these visualizations were created by professional web developers, these skills don't have to be out of reach for us.
                However, navigating through the plethora of resources available may be difficult and I hope to summarize the components critical for getting started.

                The four important components of this style of web page are:

                <ul>
                    <li>index.html</li>

                </ul><br>
                <!-- The following line is the first instance of bolded text -->
                <b>index.html</b> contains the website metadata and text content. 
                <br><br>
                <b>sections.js</b> handles data input and draws the visualization using D3.js.
                <br><br>
                <b>scroller.js</b> adds the scrolling-updating component to the website.
                <br><br>
                <b>style.css</b> provides additional styling details.
                <br><br>
                Each of these components will be explained in a section below.

                <h2>code implementation and testing</h2>
                Testing of your web page may be done through a local web server, implemented through Python.
                After setting your working directory to where the HTML is located, use the following:
                <br><br>
                <!-- The following line is the first instance of code text (rectangle border with courier font)-->
                <code>python -m http.server 8000</code>
                <br><br>
                The web page can then be accessed through <code>localhost:8000</code> in a browser.
                <br><br>
                For sharing to broader audiences, code may be commited to github and made accessible through <a href = 'https://pages.github.com/'>Github Pages</a>.
                <br><br>
                Developing your web page with a local web server will be much easier than constantly pushing updates to your Github Page repository.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class = 'step'>
                <p>
                <h2><a href = 'https://github.com/vegalla/vegalla.github.io/blob/630ea98864c60896be308f78d62004e502a6d675/ppol_563_scroller_tutorial/index.html'>index.html</a></h2>
                This file can be broken into two major sections: head and body. 
                For HTML, the head and body can be distinguished through the tags 
                <code> < head > < / head > </code> or <code> < body > < / body > </code>. 
                Understanding how tags are used is essential to writing an HTML web page.
                <br><br>
                The head contains the web page title and meta data. 
                The title appears as text within a tab of a web browser. Meta data provides additional information about the site.
                <br><br>
                In order to use D3.js, it has to be called on, as seen in line 6 of this file. 
                You may click on the header to access the HTML file, available through Github.
                Since the D3.js code is available online, it doesn't have to downloaded or installed locally to function as long as it is properly referenced.
                <br><br>
                The text you've been reading through is contained within the body section. 
                So far, I've used three HTML tags for Header 1, Header 2, and Paragraph.
                Additionally, text is particularly located in 'step' sections that incorporate the interactive scrolling, explained below.

                </p>
            </section>

            <section class = "step">
                <p>
                <h2><a href = 'https://github.com/vegalla/vegalla.github.io/blob/master/ppol_563_scroller_tutorial/sections.js'>sections.js</a></h2>
                The network graph is visualized within the sections.js file. This occurs when sections.js is called at the end of index.html.
                I'll cover the flow of code to interpret how separate files are now coordinating the visualize the graph on a single page.
                <br><br>
                First, there is a <code> < div > </code> section with the ID 'vis', located below the 'step' sections. 
                Within sections.js, this 'vis' section is assigned an Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) with width, height, and margin parameters.
                This SVG is the canvas, which the network graph is drawn on.
                <br><br>
                The graph data, as a JSON file, is imported. The graph has keys for nodes and links. 
                Each node has a unique ID and will be drawn as a circle on the graph. Each link has a source and target that connects nodes together.
                The layout of the nodes is then determined by a force simulation. The nodes are centered around the SVG and ultimately settle on a location,
                based on some repulsion/attraction paramters.
                <br><br>
                The final position of the nodes occurs iteratively from when all nodes are initially drawn on the top left corner.
                The iterations occur quick enough that it's apparently instantaneous. 
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section class = "step">
                <p>
                <br><br><br><br><br>
                At the bottom of sections.js, there are functions for actions on scrolling. 
                The scroller operates by maintaining an index of the 'step' sections and tracking user placement on the page.
                Inactive indices are faded out to maintain focus on relevant text.
                <br><br>
                Within sections.js, I would also plan to code animations, tool tips, etc. for the visualization on the right. 
                However, given the intended challenge of creating a custom visualization, I have not yet incorporated animating the network graph.
                <br><br>
                At minimum, I've maintained the fade in/out of text as the user navigates 'step' sections, compared to Cuthbert Chow's original code which show animated charts, dynamic labels, and force diagrams.
                I am still developing my own D3.js and require more time and practice to build out animations at every 'step'.
                </p>

                This JavaScript file is Cuthbert Chow's adaptation of Jim Vallandingham's <a href = 'https://github.com/vlandham/scroll_demo/blob/gh-pages/js/scroller.js'>reusable scroller</a>.
                <br><br>
                Reviewing both scripts, the functions are nearly identical with differences in the beginning concerning how variables are declared. 
                Additionally, Chow's version has stripped out Vallandingham's comments, which provide code descriptions.
                <br><br>
                For easier review, I've added back and supplemented these comments with my own.
