                <h1>How can I create an interactive data visualization that updates as users scroll through?</h1>
                <p>By Vince Egalla</a></p>
                <p>(Note: If the visualisation doesn't fit your screen, try zooming out with ctrl + - / Cmd + -.) </p>
                <p>
                This work is inspired by and draws from the work of Cuthbert Chow, Jim Vallandingham, and Michael Bostock. <br><br>

                I am inspired to provide a tutorial on this technique to assist peers in my Master's of Data Science for Public Policy
                at Georgetown University, who may be interested in creating data story websites. <br><br>

                A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may be necessary to implement this technique.
                However, even without knowledge with these languages, I hope to provide a template for peers to learn from and utilize.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                The four important components of this template are:
                <ul>
                    <li>index.html</li>
                    <li>scroller.js</li>
                    <li>section.js</li>
                    <li>style.css</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <b>index.html</b> contains the website metadata and text content
                <br><br>
                <b>scroller.js</b> adds the scrolling-updating component to the website
                <br><br>
                <b>section.js</b> handles data input and draws the visualization using D3.js
                <br><br>
                <b>style.css</b> provides additional styling details
                <br><br>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class = 'step'>
                Bear in mind that some of these figures may suffer from small sample sizes. If you hover over a bubble, you can see additional information,
                including the number of students enrolled in a given major. Salary figures from degrees with lower 
                enrolment may be less accurate due to the smaller pool of student respondents
            </section>
            <section class="step">

                <p>
                    If we rearrange all the data points into a histogram format, the salary potential of engineering majors becomes
                even more stark, as almost all the points on the right of the graph are colored yellow, for engineering. As for all the 
                other majors, they follow a fairly diverse yet tightly spaced distribution, with the modal class being
                salaries between $34,000 and $36,000.
                </p>
                
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                
                <p>
                <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the more gender 
                balanced courses.
                <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

                What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
                with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.  
                </p>
                 
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
                It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
                would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

            <section class="step">
                So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender distributions. But what are students 
                actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles 
                sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category. 
                <br><br>
                Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business related topics such as general business, business management,
                accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.

                    Hopefully, this has helped you in deciding what major you hope to study. If you want to take a deeper look into the data for yourself, you can download
